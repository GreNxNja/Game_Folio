  pc: `This is my digital command center! I'm usually crafting web wonders with Next.js, conjuring mobile magic with Flutter, and speaking the sacred language of Dart. I've dabbled in TypeScript adventures too. Programming is my playground, regardless of the language!

    Drop by my code kingdom at <a href="https://github.com/GreNxNja" target="_blank">Github</a> and see what mischief I'm up to!`,

  "cs-degree": `Behold my to-do list - the mystical scroll that guides me through the treacherous lands of computer science! It maps my heroic quests, both ongoing and those waiting beyond the horizon of technology.`,

  "sofa-table": `Ah, my legendary sofa - the soft embrace where productivity goes to die! This is my recharging station where I transform from stressed programmer to content couch potato. You'll find me here either having an intense relationship with Netflix or getting lost in book worlds.`,

  tv: `Witness my portal to digital entertainment! Lately I've fallen down rabbit holes watching tech wizards like:
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen" target="_blank">Theprimeagen</a> (keyboard warrior extraordinaire),
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg" target="_blank">Theo - t3.gg</a> (the code philosopher), and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dudeperfect" target="_blank">Dude Perfect</a> (for when my brain needs a vacation from brackets and semicolons)!`,

  bed: `Welcome to my horizontal thinking chamber! This isn't just a bed - it's an idea incubator disguised as memory foam! Some of my most brilliant code solutions materialize right here between dreams. Who needs sleep when you have eureka moments?`,

  resume: `Behold my desk of destiny, featuring the legendary scroll of qualifications! <a href="https://github.com/GreNxNja/PrithFolio/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">Dare to examine my professional journey?</a>
    
    Send a digital carrier pigeon to dev.prith13@gmail.com if you've got exciting job quests that need a coding adventurer!`,

  projects: `Journey through my hall of digital fame! Each project is a battle scar from my coding crusades - challenges faced, dragons slain, and kingdoms built. Witness my technical sagas:
    
    <a href="https://github.com/GreNxNja/Meetopia" target="_blank">Meetopia</a> (where meetings aren't boring!),
    <a href="https://github.com/GreNxNja/Mirofy" target="_blank">Mirofy</a> (not a typo of a music app),
    <a href="https://github.com/GreNxNja/Spotify_Clone" target="_blank">Bragr</a> (definitely not just another music clone), and
    <a href="https://github.com/GreNxNja/Myrtle" target="_blank">Myrtle</a> (no turtles were harmed in development)!`,

  library: `Tread carefully through my sacred gaming archive! This isn't just a collection - it's a museum of 300 digital realms waiting to transport you to worlds of adventure, strategy, and epic boss fights. Each disk contains fragments of my soul (and countless hours I probably should have spent doing something productive).`,

  exit: `Found the escape hatch, have you? If you're done exploring the quirky realm of Prithwijit's portfolio, the exit is wherever your cursor takes you! Thanks for the visit, traveler! XD`,
